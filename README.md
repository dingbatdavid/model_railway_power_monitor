# model_railway_power_monitor
 This program is basicly two INA219 modules outputing data to an LCD
Ive cobbled the code together from various sources and modified it to
suite my needs as a model railway power supply monitor for accessory and street light suplies.
It was devolped for fun and to help me learn curcuit python and play with the raspberry pi Pico.
The LCD used is a sparkfun serlcd 20x4
